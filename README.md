#### Tech and libraries

Bookverse uses several open source projects to work properly:

* [Ajax] - To send requests
* [Bootstrap] - To add styles
* [SweetAlert] - To show alerts
* [MaterialDesign] - To add theme

>Unit tests were carried out, the correct operation of the applications was validated.

And of course, Bookverse itself is open source with a public repository on GitHub.

#### Installation
